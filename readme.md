### Contributing

#### Text validation
`Vale` is a grammar, style, and word usage linter for the English language. The rules are set in the [.vale.ini](.vale.ini) file. It doesn't have a way to auto fix issues at the moment, this must be done manually.

```zsh
# install, for example through Homebrew
brew install vale

# Downloading packages ...
vale sync

# check the repository
vale .
# see even suggestions
vale --minAlertLevel=suggestion .
```

* An optional installation of the [Vale extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=errata-ai.vale-server) to display warnings and errors at once.

### Roadmap
There' s still work being done on it, but that's the direction it's going to go.
- [ ] add a command for listing starred repository from oneself and others users  `gh look star -Flags ...`
